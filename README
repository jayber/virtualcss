1. Write "perfect" meaningful html without display compromises (e.g. no extra divs)
2. Write "perfect" CSS including
    no duplication in properties for different "classes"
    no need to create either fallback properties for older browser versions or alternative browser specific implementations
    adding your own properties so far unimplemented by browsers and still have them display the way you want
3. Write selectors to apply styling and events to DOM
4. Implement event handling code in javascript
5. JS library does all the conversion of CSS properties to real properties, including
    all fallback or alternate browser version properties
    add elements to DOM in order to support style or functionality that pure semantic HTML would not
6. Marry client side events to server side events for easy event processing
